This project helps understand the implementation of Embedded Javascript(EJS).

Wherever in the ejs file '<%= %>' is encountered it fetches the data from backend and puts the value of the variable/resource.
'<% %>' encloses the javascript. And when the project is run the javascript in it is executed. This can be used to create divs dynamically based on quantity of data fetched from backend.

The index.js file is the backend. It provides the values to frontend.

The test1.ejs is the frontend file.
